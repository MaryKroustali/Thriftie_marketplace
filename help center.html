                    <h4>Anti-Discrimination and Hate Speech Policy</h4>
                    <p>Thriftie connects thoughtful consumers around the world with creative entrepreneurs. It’s an ecosystem where people of all backgrounds inspire each 
                        other and build relationships through making, selling, and buying goods. We want everyone to feel safe, and our priority is fostering 
                        an inclusive environment. This policy explains the kind of behavior we prohibit make sure we all have a positive experience.
                        This policy is a part of our Terms of Use. By using EThriftie, you’re agreeing to this policy.

                    <h4>Plastic Policy</h4>
                    <p>Although Thriftie does not ban the use of single-use/throw-away plastic we see it as an opportunity for change. 
                        So, a seller who is found or reported to be using such materials in any form will be given a warning. If this warning is ignored and the seller 
                        continues to use these prohibited materials an immediate sanction/ban will be issued, until that seller switches to an environmentally friendly 
                        alternative.  This policy also applies for recyclable plastics; this means that even if your packaging/product says it can be recycled it is 
                        prohibited from being used. The use of plastic is allowed under one certain strict circumstance:<br>
                        When the product/packaging is reusable, for example a reusable plastic container used to package a product.<br>
                        A product that replaces an existing, plastic product in society, is allowed to use plastic packaging.</p>
